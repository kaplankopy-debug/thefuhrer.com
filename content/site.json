  "intro": "This project is designed as a **citation-grade reference desk**. It indexes primary sources (with provenance) and maps them to reputable scholarship.\n\n**Core principles**\n- **Non-glorifying**: no admiration framing, no propaganda reproduction as spectacle.\n- **Evidence-led**: each page links to sources and scholarly treatments.\n- **Transparent uncertainty**: where evidence is incomplete, that is stated clearly.\n\nUse the hub pages below as entry points, or search across document cards and explainers.",
