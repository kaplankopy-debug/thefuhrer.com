# thefuhrer.com — Scholarly Portal Starter

This is a **static, citation-first** site scaffold designed to be:
- easy to host
- easy to expand
- reputationally safe (non-glorifying, educational)

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step).

## Edit content
- `content/pages.json` — policy + explainers
- `content/docs.json` — Document Cards
- `content/site.json` — home + hubs
- `content/search_index.json` — generated index (edit manually or regenerate with a script later)

## Next upgrade (optional)
If you want full-text search with highlighting, we can replace the search index with Lunr/Meilisearch.
